1. Accessing members and methods:
In static method,
- the method can only access only static data members and static methods of another class or same class but
- cannot access non-static methods and variables.
- Also a static method can rewrite the values of any static data member.
- static keyword akan membuat fungsi dapat dieksekusi langsung, tanpa harus membuat instantiate objek dari class.
In non-static method,
- the method can access static data members and static methods as well as non-static members and method of another class or same class,
- also can change the values of any static data member.
- non static method can access static data members

2. calling
In static method,
- The memory of a static method is fixed in the ram, for this reason we donâ€™t need the object of a class
In non-static method,
- the memory of non-static method is not fixed in the ram, so we need class object to call a non-static method.
nonStaticExample n = new nonStaticExample();
System.out.println(n.lebar);

3.Binding process:
In static method,
- the method use compile time or early binding. For this reason we can access static method without creation a instance.
In non-static method,
- the method use runtime or dynamic binding. So that we cannot access a non-static method without creation a instance.

4. Overriding:
In static method, we cannot override a static method, because of early binding.
    static void gerobak(){

    }

5. Memory allocation:
In static method,
- memory allocation happens only once, because the static keyword fixed a particular memory for that method in ram. less memory
In non-static method,
- here memory allocation happens when the method is invoked and the memory is allocated every time when the method is called.
  So much memory is used here.
